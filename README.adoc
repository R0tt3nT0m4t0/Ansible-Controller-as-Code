= AnsibleProject

== Organize Your Repository

Setup dedicated repository for your ansible projects, which includes playbooks, roles, and inventories. You might want to have a structure like this:

.Directory Structure
[source,shell]
----
.
├── inventories
│   ├── dev
│   ├── stage
│   └── produ
├── roles
├── playbooks
├── templates
└── ansible.cfg
----

This allows you to separate inventories for different environments, like development, staging, and production.
